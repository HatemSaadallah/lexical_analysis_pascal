# C++ Lexical Analyzer for Pasacl Language

### This is a school project and by is means of perfect, but it is a good start.
### DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANY REAL PURPOSE.

#### If you're looking for util functions and hacky ways for string manipulation, please refer to the utils folder.

#### The code needs some more refactoring, but it is in relatively good shape, and I don't want to invest more time on it.
